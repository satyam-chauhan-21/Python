-> suppose we work in python shell and we opened a file in that terminal using "import".
-> now think we updated that file and now we want to use that values(variable which also known as attribute in python)
    for that first way is => we can re import that file or module 
            second way => we simply close that shell and do that import thing again 
        by using above tow way we can do sometimes but that are not correct ways bucause it might be costly sometimes

    for that we can import reload from importlib and now we can use reload() method to reload our files,
        for example we want to reloat "hello.py" so we can simply do this,
        >>>from importlib import reload
        >>>reload(hello)
